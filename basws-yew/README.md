basws-yew is a client for the basws WebSocket framework. For more information, see the [basws README](../README.md).

To set up your own protocol client:

- Implement the `ClientLogic` trait
- Interact with ApiAgent in a similar fashion that you would interact with other Yew agents.

TODO: Create a Yew example.
